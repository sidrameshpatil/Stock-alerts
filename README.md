This was meant to be just a simple node application to run on my friend's local machine, 
so sending emails using gmail wasn't possible because gmail's increased security measures.
so I used Twilio, the excluded the twilio related code, but still the index file consist all the twilio code except the auth token and sttuff.
so if you want to use it you either need to add your own twilio credential or you can use some other messege sending API or mail sending API or you can also just run 
on the local machine to test the code but you need to remove the left out twilio code which i havent excluded yet.
